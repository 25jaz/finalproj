                            1. Can I return items at the time of delivery?
We make sure all the products are new or almost new when they reach you without compromising on quality. There are a series of stringent quality checks that are undertaken on every piece of furniture before delivery. However, if you don’t like the products at the time of delivery, you can return them - there will be no questions asked.
Once the item(s) are accepted by yourself or your representative (anyone receiving the order on your behalf) we mark them as delivered and thus, if you wish to return any of the item(s), you will be asked to place a Subscription Closure request which may involve a small Early closure charge, depending upon the tenure you had chosen during checkout.
Only items with major defects or non-functionality will be taken back free of Early closure charge. Since the dimensions for all products are mentioned on the website, we will not be able to accept any returns based on that criteria. However, some genuine issues can be discussed over a call and we might take items back, but only if pointed out at the time of delivery. Unfortunately, free returns cannot be initiated once the delivery is accepted by you or your representatives.
To ensure that you face no issues regarding this, Infinity team will leave your premises only when you are satisfied with the order.

2  SECURITY DEPOSIT POLICY:
In addition to the monthly rental, the Customer shall pay a refundable security deposit (“Security Deposit”) at the time of delivery before accepting it. The Security Deposit shall not carry any interest for the entire tenure. The Security Deposit shall be refunded to the Customer on the termination and after taking delivery of all the Products from the possession of the Customer. Once the final quality check is performed on all the Products, and in case no damage is found, the Security Deposit shall be refunded within 15-21 working days to the Customer. Infinity shall refund the Security Deposit to the account from which initial the Security Deposit was paid by the Customer or in cash, in case the Customer wishes to get the refund to any other account, the Customer shall provide the details of the account to Infinity via e-mail from the registered e-mail address of the Customer , prior to the pickup of the Products. The same account details shall be confirmed at the time of the reverse pick up of the Products. In case any damage is found in any Product, Infinity shall have the right to deduct the charges for the damages or monthly dues from the Security Deposit paid by the Customer and shall refund the remaining amount to the Customer.
 In case of default in the payment of monthly rentals (including late fee), Infinity shall have the right to deduct such rental dues from the Security Deposit and may at its sole discretion refund or forfeit the remaining balance of the Security Deposit. The Security Deposit shall not include any monthly rental. The Customer cannot request for the monthly invoice dues to be adjusted from the Security Deposit.


3. How would I get my refundable deposit back?
If a clean chit is provided based on the QC report and all your dues towards Infinity have been cleared, the whole amount of refundable deposit will be transferred to account from where initial deposit was received. The mode of payment would be NEFT & would be credited to the account within 7 working days. NEFT Details shared should be under the name of the Customer on whose name the order was placed. In case the customer wants money in a different account, the requisite account details need to be communicated via email from the registered email id through which the order was placed.
A written confirmation will also be required at the time of return pick up after which Infinity will not be liable for further claims. Please make sure that the account details for the transfer are shared with Infinity. In case of any damage, the products will undergo further inspection at Infinity’s premises to ascertain the damage cost. This damage cost will then be mitigated from the refundable deposit paid by you.
4. Are there any charges for cancellation?
No, we do not charge any amount for cancelling your order upto the time of item delivery.
